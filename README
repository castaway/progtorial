An interactive DBIC tutorial.
------------------------------------

The idea is that the user takes part by interactively coding parts of the solution, building on their code as they progress through the tutorial.

Each user therefore needs an own copy of the code/environment.

We need to be able to test / build the user's code safely on the host (chroot).

We need oto have a set of pre-defined tests that the code is run against to show the user how they are progressing.

See todo.org for a set of Tasks, in Emacs org-mode format.
