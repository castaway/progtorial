How to learn / try out a module without the frustrating/faffing of installing it?

Let someone else install it. 

Try it online. Actual interactive coding.

Read about the module, try the exercises.

PASS or FAIL the exercise, yes its just a perl unit test file!

Obligatory social media add-ons, friending, openid, comments etc.

Help needed! Github! http://github.com/castaway/progtorial
