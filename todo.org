* Decisions
** DONE Path to user environment .. username/XX?
** TODO User Auth, OpenID?

** DONE layout of "system" skeletons/ = tarballs & content for base tutorial
 exercises/ = subdir per chapter? containing tests/ dir, lib/ containing full
 solution needed up until this chapter to solve
 the current test, minus whatever the test is testing. overlay this onto the user's lib dir
 if requested, or they haven't done previous codings.
** DONE How to keep track which items the user has done?
  Individual items done, so far, bookmarks and exercise results can be used as "latest activities" 
** TODO Docs in module code, do we set AUTHOR / etc for the user?
 
*** TODO Ch1 - setup of dbic schema files
